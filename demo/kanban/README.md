# Jmix Kanban Demo

## Overview

The application's data model includes the `User` entity, [KanbanTask](src/main/java/com/company/kanban/entity/KanbanTask.java) entity and [TaskStatus](demo/kanban/src/main/java/com/company/kanban/entity/TaskStatus.java) enumeration. The `KanbanTask` entity has a reference to the `User` entity in its `assignee` attribute.

The [kanban-board-view](src/main/resources/com/company/kanban/view/kanbanboard/kanban-board-view.xml) loads all `KanbanTask` entities from the database and displays them using the `kanban` UI component.

## Demo Scenario

1. Run the application and go to <http://localhost:8103> in your browser.
2. Log in as `admin` with password `admin`.
3. Open the *Application â†’ Kanban board* view. 
4. Use drag-and-drop to move tasks between columns and change their status. Double-click on a task to open the `KanbanTask` detail view.
